Our beloved tadelakt pottery collection has a soft, undulating character, and now makes a stunning table lamp. The craft of tadelakt is a Moroccan tradition, using lime from The  Marrakech Plateau, where the original tadelakt lime can be found. That's  where the word ""tadelakt"" comes from, it means ""to rub in"", where olive  soap is rubbed in resulting in a hydrophobic lime plaster used on both  the interior and exteriors of buildings. </p><p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">W 18"" x D 18"" x H 26.5""</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty=""true"" style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""></p>",PHYSICAL,,Table,TRUE,https://static1.squarespace.com/static/553bbe08e4b08cd58584aa12/5b74a51c8a922dd7291eb135/5c8a5dde6e9a7f68ca618729/1552571875838/Tadelakt_Lamp_Black.jpg,SQ6855757,,,,,,,600.00 USD,0.00 USD,,10,18,18,26.5,0
